## MediaPipe Pose Tutorial

The Jupyter notebook uses opencv and MediaPipe for real time pose detection by calculating the angles between joints.
I have added a Bicep Curl Counter and a Squat counter, which helps you calculate your Reps real time.
This one is specially for my Gym Bros :D

Feel free to add more excersices to it.
